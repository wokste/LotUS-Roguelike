# Project management
Currently, I am the only person contributing on this projecct and managing it. I use a seperate document for long-term goals. Please don't make issues for features you think may be useful, if you don't know the long term goals. I could easily create 50 issues but it will not make me faster.

If you want to use the code, go ahead. It is open source for a reason and the license is pretty permissive. The code depends on SFML.net so you may need to NuGet it. I personally use vs2017 and windows but I see no reason why it shouldn't work on MonoDevelop and Linux.

I am currently not looking for contributors. However, if you want to become a contributor, please contact me and we will further discuss it. There are several communication channels to be set up and I want to be sure it is worth it. Finally, if I decide that I won't accept you as a contributor, don't feel insulted. It will probably be me that finds this step scary.
